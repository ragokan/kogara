With Kogara, you can use almost any extension functions on Vue reactivity. For example, you can use most of [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) utilities.

_Some of them may not work properly with Devtools, but most of them works fine._

Moreover, you can create your own extensions or use the default Kogara extensions which are similar to VueUse but has %100 Kogara Devtools support. You can check the next section for more details.
