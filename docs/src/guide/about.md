# About

Kogara is such a simple state management library. It aims to have a great developer experience while affect the production code as less as possible.

While creating this library, I get inspired by [Harlem](https://harlemjs.com/) and [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/). Basically, I wanted to use their best features and make it small, fast, easy and extensible as possible.
